## Say Hello To My Little Friends, Bacteria!
For this project I was provided a json file full of information about each test subject and their test results. Using the powers of HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT, I created this interactive dashboard to show each individuals results.
![starting page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19378130/184557473-bc73d647-c7f4-45b7-82f5-0b1b20c1b2a5.PNG)

Once a test subject's ID has been selected, you can see their results through the three graphs.
First, our bar chart will show you the top ten OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units, or families) of bacteria found in thier belly button. (This is for ID 1310)

To the right, we have out gauge chart. This shows how much each test subject washed their navel each week. (This is for ID 956)

At the bottom of our page, we have this beautiful scatter chart with bubbles that indicates the OTU size of each bacteria culture for our test subject. (This is ID 1258)
